# Agenda

Too many, too long, too little, too late.

Time to put pressure on all of the powers that be and demand what we want.

[We demand EVERYTHING](https://github.com/the-agenda/agenda/blob/master/demands/demands.md)

**20 year mission**: Remove the systems of racism

10 year vision: Black and minorities are in positions of power in and have strong representation: government, business, policing, financial markets, home ownership, education, technology and overall leadership in this country. Black people across America can expect due justice when faced racism. Black people stop being murdered just for being black. We need to become a single voice that the country cannot ignore without consequence. 

This means
- Supporting black owned businesses
- Giving black owned businesses the tools to compete and succeed at the highest levels
- Fund black people funding for businesses especially in technology. (We are the culture worldwide, social networks promote culture, why are we not in control?)
- Ensuring we are well represented in politics at all levels across the country
- Pay attention across the state and local levels to all Sheriff and DA positions
- Get laws passed that make racism and discrimination painful to offenders
- Going to the polls consistently and voting in people who will support our agenda
- Getting more black students into higher education, getting systems to ensure more students graduate high school and have affordable college options
- Get black home ownership levels up

Our education system also needs to fully educate children on the history of the country. There are entire history programs designed around the holocaust at most colleges. Slavery? Not so much so. Slavery should not just be one chapter in a text book.

**5 year vision**: TBD

**3 year vision**: We are the culture. Worldwide. We already have a stage full of artists across all disciplines holding onto people's eyes, ears and tongues. Let’s activate the machine.
Unify black sports players across all American sports to take a knee during the anthem. Carry on Colin Kaepernick;s work. If they fire all of you, we have enough to start our own leagues
Rap is the most popular form of music in the world. Get our artists to spread the message. Throw on “Fuck the KKK” on a fire track. Tell your favorite rapper.

**Annual vision**: We track the number of black people murdered and racists events reported around the country. Look at the trends to see them going down. If they are going up or staying flat we need to re-adjust

**Quarterly goals**: TBD

**Monthly goals**: TBD

**Right now**: Keep making them hear your voice
