# Demands
Too many, too long, too little, too late.

Time to put pressure on all of the powers that be and demand what we want.

## Unorganized demands
- Arrest the other 3 officers involved in the murder of George Floyd; because yes, they are all culpable.

- Sheriffs must be elected, not appointed. We must elect local sheriffs that will enforce the constitution and the law equally for all. The sheriff has constitutional arresting power over local and state police. If there is injustice there must be pressure on the sheriff to react accordingly. If your local sheriff is appointed, petition to have that changed immediately. We should recognize how important it is at this juncture to not be bureaucratically led. The sheriff is the only police force brought about by our constitution. Every other police force is 'rule by decree.' This is part of a new (1776) checks and balances system.

- Local police must only be allowed to work in the community in which they live. The community would mirror what their local precinct covers in terms of territorial jurisdiction. This idea is to encourage community between citizens and police. To help bridge the ever growing gap of trust, while at the same time discouraging cops from doing dirt on the beat, around their neighbors.

- Throw out all judges that are known for having racist slants when sentencing individuals facing criminal charges more harshly because of the color of their skin.

- End slave labor in the US prison system.

- Ban privately owned prisons and end contracts that require local governments to keep them 90% full via prison quotas. This would help to end the encouragement of throwing minorities in jail for questionable offences.

- Make it illegal to fund and source controlled opposition protests or to pay people to protest. I’m looking at you, George Soros and The Open Society Foundation. If you are paying foot soldiers to protest and cause havoc to co-opt a movement and steer it towards your political agenda then you are a financial terrorist and should be charged as such.

- Restore Posse Comitatus. The 2012 NDAA Act ended a 130 year old law that forbids military involvement in law enforcement. In other words, Posse Comitatus prevented the U.S. military from arresting it's own citizens. That would be a literal dictatorship, if ever enforced and laws are written with plans to enforce them.

- Eliminate Quotas in policing. This contributes to 'policing for profit' and further separates the modern day militarized police officer from the peace officer of years passed.

- If a law enforcement officer is caught undercover, posing as part of a protest movement and breaks the law, he will be given the maximum sentence for that law broken.

- End the 1033 Program. Police must forfeit all equipment awarded to them from 1033 as well as police drones.

- Abolish facial recognition cameras, automated license plate readers and retrain local police in non lethal situation ending tactics. retrain SWAT teams as well to improve protocols.

- Make redlining and gentrification illegal practices with harsh sentences and enforce it.

- End the 'Paid Details' program across the board. Off duty police should not be available for hire by private corporations.

- Strip Derek Chauvin of his pension. If Chauvin is convicted for the murder of George Floyd, Minnesota state law does not revoke pensions for tenured officers for felony offenses. Meaning Chauvin still gets paid for sitting in jail.

- 100% Accountability of abuse by police! You kill, maim, or mentally abuse someone in police custody, the arresting officer and those associated should be fired and held criminally responsible.

- The police union should foot the bill for all criminal settlements. Any payment to wronged civilians should come from their wallets.

- All officers convicted or fired in criminal acts shall forfeit their pension to community improvement programs( after school programs for underprivileged children, infrastructure projects, accessible parks)

- Police should be put on a rotating schedule to prevent mental fatigue and PTSD to prevent seeing the community they serve as enemies

- All police, including detectives, should live in the city they serve. You can’t police a community if you don’t live there

- Citizen review boards. Officers are held accountable by citizen review boards as an outside performance review, as well as a review of individual incidents.

- Independent agencies shall be erected to investigate and flag internal events of police misconduct.

- New legislation needs to be passed to establish and uphold penalties of police misconduct.

- Establish regulation on police officer recruitment standards. These standards need to be increased.

- Not sure how to word this, but there needs to be a massive reigning in or breaking up of police unions.

- No Cop Rapists.

- Take The Serial Killings Of 50+ Black Women In That City The Racists Love To Bring Up Seriously And Investigate Our Deaths And Disappearances.

- Stop Planting Shit On My Black Brothers.

- Stop Talking About Black On Black Crime When White Supremacist Groups Are Not Labelled Terrorist Organizations But Black Lives Matter And Antifa Are.

- Every Single Cop Needs Body Cam And Dash Cam With Sound Turned On Them At All Times Or Else They Are Fired.

- Unbiased Media Coverage Of Our Unjust Killings And Disappearances

- Stop Expecting Us To Forgive You In Front Of Cameras To Make You Feel Good About Letting White People Get Away With Murder.

- School to prison pipeline. There are a ton of factors that play into this, but a failing school is one of the biggest plagues in the black communities... One aspect I'd love to see is more Black men in schools as mentors and classroom management. So many schools in black neighborhoods are filled with majority white staff. And I can't blame the well-meaning Jessicas; nobody else wants to do it! Maybe offenders with misdemeanors and nonviolent crimes could do community service in elementary schools as para-professionals and get a path to earning college credits in education. On a whole we need more Black teachers!

- Why are police unions so strong when labor orgs in other blue collar industries have declined for years?

- Police brutality settlements shouldn't be footed by tax payers. There has to be a stronger incentive to keep cops from beating the shit out of people.

- Being a police officer is a difficult job. Physically and emotionally. There should be a higher standard for hiring, more on-the-job counseling and training and ultimately, better pay. This goes the same for corrections officers.

- A restructuring of civil forfeiture laws. I don't know much about it, but the fact they can arrest an innocent person, but keep their shit is insane to me.
